# README 

 `Newton` is a code made for studying the coupling between neutronics and termohidraulics in a nuclear reactor core.
 
>It can solve the residual coupling equations with different kind of methods, accelerating the convergence of the problem.

###`Newton`:

```bash
make
```

##Running `Newton` on multiple processors

```bash
mpirun -np 2 Newton
```

## The future

* Performance evaluation 

* Scripts to test the code

* Benchmarking

* Documentation
