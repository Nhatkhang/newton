\bf{Newton} is a master code that solves explicit and implicit coupling in nonlinear calculations. It was designed with a general purpose. 
For example, it can be used in multiscale coupled problems, in CFD-temalhydraulic problems, in neutronic-termalhydraulic problems, and others.
These are the main features of the code:
\begin{itemize} 
 \item Capable of coupling all kind of codes.
 \item Easy to use.
 \item Respect the GNU project philosophy.
\end{itemize}
This is the user's manual. Here you find everything necessary to prepare the input and solve a coupling problem.
